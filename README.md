## ðŸ“‚ Project Layout

By default, your workspace includes two essential folders:

- **`src`:** Houses your Java source files.
- **`lib`:** Holds your project dependencies such as libraries and JAR files.

### Compiled Files

The compiled Java classes will automatically be placed in the **`bin`** directory. This keeps your workspace neat and organized.

> **Tip:** You can tweak the folder structure by editing the `.vscode/settings.json` file to align with your project needs.

## ðŸ›  Managing Dependencies

The **`JAVA PROJECTS`** view in VS Code makes handling dependencies a breeze. You can:

- Effortlessly add or remove external libraries.
- View and organize your project dependencies.
